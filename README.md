Here is a Repository for paper entitled Characteristics of Chaotic time series generated by convolutional  generative adversarial networks.

This repository contains code to train GAN models to generate chaotic time series and to analyze the generated time series nonlinear time series.


## Requirements

These codes were developed with Tensorflow 2.7 and Python 3.9.10.

## Files

- `chaosgan.py` trains Generator and Discriminator.

- `chaosgan_analysis.py` performs analysis of GAN-generated time-series. (including results in Fig. 1 - Fig. 3 )

- `chaosgan_errors.py` performs analysis of errors (including results in Fig. 4).

- `models.py` defines GAN models

- `nltsa.py` implements nonlinear time series analysis algorithms.

- `tools.py` defines trajectory generator class, transition error calculation class, and plotting functions.

- `parzen.py` implements Parzen window (kernel density estimation) method and estimation of KL divergence.



## Usage

### Training models

```
python chaosgan.py
```

### Running analysis

After the training, run

```
python chaosgan_analysis.py
```

and then: 

```
python chaosgan_errors.py
```



## Model Architecture


The graphs shows architecture of the generator and discriminator.
These graphs are generated by  `tf.keras.utils.plot_model()`.
